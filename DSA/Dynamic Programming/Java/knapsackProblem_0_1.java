    //  Imagine the weights are 1,2,3  and the values are 2,4,1. How can we choose two items such that total value is maximum
    //  We will make an arraylist of weights vs number of different weights. Here we will make 
    // and then we can see that holding weight 2 and 3 will be a wise option.
